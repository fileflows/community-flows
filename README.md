# üåê FileFlows Community Flows

Welcome to the **Community Flows** repository!  
This is the place to share your custom FileFlows flows with others‚Äîand discover new ones to enhance your setup.

## üöÄ How to Share Your Flow

Contributing is easy! Just follow these steps:

1. **Create a folder** with your username or handle  
   _Example: `flows/yourname/`_

2. **Inside that folder**, create a subfolder for each flow  
   _Example: `flows/yourname/MyCoolFlow/`_

3. **Add a preview image** of your flow  
   - Use `preview.png` or `preview.webp`  
   - This helps others quickly see what your flow does

4. **Include your exported flow file**  
   - Export your flow from FileFlows as `.json`  
   - Place it in the same folder as the preview

5. **Submit a pull request**  
   - Once your files are added, open a PR to share it with the community!
